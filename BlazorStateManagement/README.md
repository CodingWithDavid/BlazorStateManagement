# Blazor Components

This project was created to help me learn and remember the state management in a Blazor Application.

## Why

State management is a key part of any SPA web application.  YOu need to be able to pass state between pages.  Simple things like user info, permissions, configurations all need to be maintain on the client side to avoid a lot of repetitive calls.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorStateManagement
   cd BlazorStateManagement
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template and adding state management to the "Counter" page.  The sample also shows how to set up state management between components using an event handler
